This is a github website for my persnoal profile.

Using docusaurus (https://docusaurus.io/)

I faced some issues deploying the site from copying the build folder generated by ```$ yarn build```. To solve that I used the deployment steps in docusaurus offical website ``` $GIT_USER=Github_UserName DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=Github_Branch yarn deploy```
