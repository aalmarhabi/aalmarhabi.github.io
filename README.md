# Master branch is not in use
The master branch is used for an old website. Now the GitHub page in use is the docusaurus branch.


# aalmarhabi.github.io
This is a GitHub website for my personal profile.

Using docusaurus (https://docusaurus.io/)

I faced some issues deploying the site from copying the build folder generated by ```$ yarn build```. To solve that, I used the deployment steps on docusaurus official website ``` $GIT_USER=Github_UserName DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=Github_Branch yarn deploy```


# How to modify
1- Make changes locally while running ```$yarn start```
2- Build your final website ```$yarn build```
3- deploy ``` $GIT_USER=Github_UserName DEPLOYMENT_BRANCH=Github_Branch yarn deploy```
