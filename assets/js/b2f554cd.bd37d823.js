The reason for that is the current AGI, especially Openai Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT), even with the incredible improvement, cannot replace the whole process an individual is doing. You still need to tweak or modify AGI\'s final output, regardless of speeding up the time of doing specific tasks.  \\n\\n## When AGI Will Replace People\\n \\nWhen AGI can produce an output that does not need to be modified or tweaked with the production\'s reliability. For example:\\n - Ask AGI to make a complete system design for specific applications. Then AGI does it from A to Z, which includes building deploy code, a testing server, handle storage.\\n - Ask AGI to handel flight schedule in real time. Give the plane permission to land and another to wait in the sky while the landing lane gets empty.\\n \\nThen at that level, AGI can replace people. And new jobs in monitoring with a degree of understanding of what is happening. But you will need one person and AGI to replace a large team of 100+ people. \\n\\n## Future\\nIn the future, many valuable AGIs will be specific to particular areas or even countries. One thing I am interested in is reaching a possible AGI-to-AGI communication without any issues."},{"id":"personal","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/personal","editUrl":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi/blog/2022-03-17--tripDisney.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-03-17--tripDisney.md","title":"Trip To Disney World","description":"Sharing a personal post.

I enjoyed all the ride experiences there, and for my bad luck, I did not try the Pirate of the Carbine ride. The firework performance for 50 years celebration was unbelievable at the end of the day. \\n\\n![Magic Kingdome before firework show](../static/img/disney_magic_kingdom_nigth.jpeg)\\n *Magic Kingdome before firework show*\\n\\n# EPCOT\\nThe rides at EPCOT were okay, but the most thriller one was the guardian of the galaxy ride. At that time, the line was long but worth the wait. The remarkable thing about EPCOT the had several regions that represent different countries and their food. France, Japan, Canada, Germany, Morocco, and more were there. \\n\\nI plan to go back if I have another chance and stop at Universal studio, too, there.

I learned about Emacs around 2019 (what\'s wrong with me, I know!) while taking a data structure class. The professor used it to quickly make a buffer (a new window to write the text) but never forced anyone to use it. I got interested in Emacs but only switched partially to it. I was using the Atom text editor at that time. My journey with Emacs was a bit long, and many people will be hesitant to start fully using it. But I want to share maybe how to make it easier. \\n\\n## Emacs Vs. All Other IDE:\\nMany people compare Emacs with a text editor like Vim, VSCode, sublime, or Atom. Or even comparing it with IDE like JetBrains IDE. **BUT** Emacs is not just a text editor or IDE. It is more of a complete operating system in a program! So you can use it as a text editor and configure any programming languages you want. Emacs was built to be customizable, and you can do whatever you want. It uses lisp (emacs-lisp) programming language to write much functionality in Emacs, and you don\'t need to know lisp. \\n\\nI had so many important projects, and I was using MATLAB, Clion, and PyCharm at that time and wanted to avoid taking the risk of using Emacs. However, once I got comfortable using it, it became my to-go choice every time.\\n\\n## How to Start With Emacs\\nThe best thing you can do is to keep yourself from overwhelming yourself with all the features Emacs can offer. To do that, I recommend the following [Install GNU Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/): \\n\\n- Master using key binding in Emacs (give yourself a week). You can do that as a first step. Go over the Emacs tutorial to do that (you don\'t need to finish it all, only how to navigate). \\n- Watch the first three parts of the Emacs from scratch series on [Youtube by System Crafters Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SystemCrafters/playlists). \\n- Only spend a little bit of time in the course series. Remember, don\'t want to overwhelm yourself. \\n- Use already setup configuration (copy both init.el (.el =  emacs-lisp) and Emacs.org (.org = emacs org mode) in [GitHub repo](https://github.com/daviwil/emacs-from-scratch)\\n- Pick any side project you have and commit to using Emacs with it\\n- As you use Emacs more, you will learn more things."},{"id":"greetings","metadata":{"permalink":"/blog/greetings","editUrl":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi/blog/2022-02-11--greetings.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-02-11--greetings.md","title":"Greetings, Frist Post!","description":"This is my first post on blog using Docusaurus.","date":"2022-02-11T00:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"February 11, 2022","tags":[{"label":"greetings","permalink":"/blog/tags/greetings"}],"readingTime":1.19,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Alhussain Almarhabi","title":"Main author","url":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi","image_url":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi.png"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"greetings","title":"Greetings, Frist Post!","authors":[{"name":"Alhussain Almarhabi","title":"Main author","url":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi","image_url":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi.png","imageURL":"https://github.com/aalmarhabi.png"}],"tags":["greetings"]},"prevItem":{"title":"Emacs, Taking Over Your Life!","permalink":"/blog/emacs"}},"content":"This is my first post on blog using Docusaurus.\\n\\nWhy Docusaurus?
